# Echoes.dll

`Echoes.dll` is a small library that can be optionally used in Elements projects for the .NET platform to support the `Dynamic` type.

`Echoes.dll` ships precompiled with the [Elements](http://elementscompiler.com). Should you need to add a reference to it to your project, you can do so via the [Add References](http://docs.elementscompiler.com/Projects/References) dialog in Fire or Visual Studio, where the `Echoes.dll.` library should show automatically.

`Echoes.dll` used to be called `Remobjects.Elements.Dynamic.dll`.

The code for this library is open source and available under a liberal license. We appreciate contributions.
